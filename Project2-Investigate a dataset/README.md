# European Soccer Dataset

### Project Question: 
> Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. 
Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Chosen Dataset:

* [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/discussion)

### Contents:

* The repository consists of two files, one being the Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` file  which has the analysis performed and the other one being the `.html` 
version of the same.

* I have answered a total of 4 questions by performing exploratory data analysis on the data (extracted using SQLite library in python).

### Running the notebook:

* To check the results and answer more possible questions, you can run the notebook yourself by first downloading the database from the above link
as well as downloading the notebook from this repository and then running it locally in your setup using the Jupyter Notebook interface.
