### Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions

**Summary**

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to 
overall global temperature trends.

**Instructions**

Your goal will be to create a visualization(line plot) and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between 
global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

Since the database is a private database, I have run the SQL queries and extracted the data in the csv file `data.csv`.
